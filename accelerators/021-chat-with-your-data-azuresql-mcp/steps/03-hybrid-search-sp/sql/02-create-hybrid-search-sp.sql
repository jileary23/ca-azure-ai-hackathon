 Step 3 / SQL 02 — dbo.find_similar_reviews_hybrid stored procedure

 What this does:
   Takes a free-text query string. Returns the top-N matching reviews
   ranked by a hybrid (vector + keyword) score using Reciprocal Rank
   Fusion (RRF).

 How it works:
   1. Embed the query via dbo.get_embedding (step 2).
   2. Compute the top-50 reviews by cosine vector distance.
   3. Compute the top-50 reviews by full-text rank (FREETEXTTABLE).
   4. FULL OUTER JOIN on ReviewID and combine with:
          rrf_score = 1 / (60 + vector_rank) + 1 / (60 + keyword_rank)
      The constant 60 is the standard RRF damping factor; rows missing
      from one ranking are treated as rank 1000 so they still get *some*
      mass but are dominated by rows that appear in both.
   5. Return the top-N with both component ranks/scores so callers can
      see WHY a row ranked highly.

 Why RRF over weighted-sum:
   Cosine similarity (~0.0–1.0) and FREETEXT rank (typically 0–1000+)
   are on wildly different scales. Trying to weight them directly forces
   you to pick magic numbers per dataset. RRF only cares about RANK
   order so it's robust without tuning.

 RUNNING THIS SCRIPT
   Option A — via deploy.ps1 (recommended).
   Option B — from your SQL Editor: connect to ProductsDB and run.
   (No tokens to edit. The endpoint + deployment are passed AS PARAMETERS
   on every call instead of being baked in — same shape as get_embedding.)
